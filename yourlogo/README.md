Automation Practise task 

For this task I choose to use automation tools Selenium, cucumber with language of Java.

I set my tests out with a page object model objective to complete them.

I used Gherkin to write my steps that I wanted to use for my test

I created one runner to run the one step file as all steps and page methods will be run from there with all tests included.

When you run the steps "run test" all of the steps will run methods that have been split into different page objects.

In the page objects all the elements and methods have been stored and named clearly so it should be clear what each one achieves.
